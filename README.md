Example Playbook
------------------

Add the large_image role to your requirements.yml file:

	- src: https://github.com/girder/ansible-role-large-image

Here is a playbook which installs svs and tiff tile sources
and includes vips so that we can run conversion tasks with girder_worker.

	---

	- hosts: servers
	  tasks:
	  - include_role:
		  name: ansible-role-large-image
		  vars:
			large_image_virtualenv: "/path/to/a/virtualenv"
			large_image_tile_sources:
			  - svs
			  - tiff
			large_image_include_vips: true
	  ...
